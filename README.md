## Reference

This project utilises data from [Kaggle's Top 500 Melbourne Eateries: TripAdvisor's Best](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/top-500-melbourne-eateries-tripadvisors-best).

## Overview: (Marianne)

Melbourne is famous for its food culture. People travel to Melbourne just to experience all the amazing restaurants, bars, and cafes it has on offer. With such an abundance of choices, deciding where to dine can often feel overwhelming. To address this, our team has developed a user-friendly webpage designed to simplify these decisions for both locals and tourists alike.

We did this by utilising Trip Adviser data from Kaggle with information about the “Top 500 Melbourne Eateries”. This data set had information about name, price, address, number of reviews, and rating. 

We made our visualisations using JavaScript, and have displayed 4 different widgets on a webpage for users to explore. These visualizations are not just about presenting data; they are carefully designed to provide insights such as:

-	The diversity of cuisine types across Melbourne, highlighting areas with a high concentration of particular cuisines.
-	Pricing levels of eateries, helping users find options that fit their budget.
-	Geographic distribution of restaurants, bars, and cafes, allowing users to discover popular spots in specific suburbs or neighbourhoods.

We believe we have curated a user-friendly experience which will give curious Melbourne foodies great insights into where they should explore next.

## Ethical Considerations (Marianne)
In creating our project on Melbourne's dining scene, we focused on three main areas to ensure we were upholding high ethical standards, including when using data from TripAdvisor.

The first was adhering to data copyright laws. When using the TripAdvisor data, we ensured our use complied with their terms of service and copyright rules. This meant we could use the data about restaurants without breaking any rules and only used the information in ways which TripAdvisor allows. Secondly, we made sure we weren’t breaching the Privacy Act 1988, which exists to protect people’s personal information. As our data only captured public information about the restaurant, and not names or personal details of people who left reviews, we believe we were able to adhere to this standard. Lastly, we took into consideration if Trip Advisor uses a fair algorithm when generating the list of top restaurants, or if it’s computer program would produce any bias that would affect the results. As the data collected is directly from people who have visited and rated the restaurant, we believe that this wouldn’t be a concern in our data set. For example, we weren’t asking trip advisor to predict what restaurants are good, but simply look for restaurants that people have rated highly themselves.

By focusing on these points and ensuring our use of TripAdvisor data was responsible, respectful, fair, and within the law, we aimed to create a project that provides valuable insights into Melbourne's dining scene while adhering to ethical and legal standards.
